# RUX-RNA-SEQ

This RNA-SEQ pipeline is designed for the computational prediction of transcripts in the genome. All you need is a Galaxy account (it's free and it comes with 200GB!). No coding skills required!

I've collected data from 27 independent studies and focused on 20,500 nt in a "dark" region of a human genome. See RUX-RNA-SEQ.pdf for more information.
